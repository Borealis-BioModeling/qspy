# What is QSP Modeling?

[Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_systems_pharmacology) integrates traditional pharmacological modeling (e.g., PK/PD modeling) and mechanistic systems biology modeling (e.g., biochemical network modeling) to better understand how drugs interact with biological targets, affect biochemical pathways, and how biological systems and diseases respond to drug intervention. The resulting mathematical models can thus integrate knowledge and data on drug pharmacokinetics, drug mechanism-of-action (MoA), biological pathways, and disease processes to better understand drug effects and treatment potential. 

QSP models are particularly useful for in silico hypothesis testing and prediction, supporting drug discovery and development decisions in areas such as target selection, dose optimization, and precision medicine.

The following diagram gives a reasonable overview of QSP models and an associated modeling workflow:

This diagram shows a systems biology modeling workflow, which is also highly applicable to QSP modeling:
