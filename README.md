# QSPy: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology in Python

QSPy ('Cue Ess Pie') is a Python-based framework for the programmatic construction of rule-based mathematical models that describe drugs and their interactions with biological systems. Designed for quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP), QSPy enables the modular and reproducible modeling of complex drugâ€“biology interactions.
