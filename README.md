# QSPy: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology in Python

QSPy ('Cue Ess Pie') is a Python-based framework for the programmatic construction of rule-based mathematical models that describe drugs and their interactions with biological systems. Built on [PySB](https://pysb.org/), it enables modular modeling and simulation of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models.
