# QSPy: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology in Python

QSPy ('Cue Ess Pie') is a Python-based framework for the programmatic construction of rule-based mathematical models that describe drugs and their interactions with biological systems. It builds on the [PySB](https://pysb.org/) framework to enable modular, rule-based construction and simulation of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models.
